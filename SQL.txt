Writing SQL queries is simple, but writing that in an efficient way will make you appear different in a data analyst interview. So here are some ways to write an efficient SQL query:-


* Use SELECT statements to retrieve only the necessary data.


* Use proper indexing to improve query performance.


* Use UNION ALL instead of UNION if possible since UNION ALL doesn't remove duplicates.
* Avoid using subqueries if possible, as they can slow down performance.


* Use INNER JOIN instead of OUTER JOIN if you only need to retrieve matching records.
* Avoid using wildcard characters in the beginning of LIKE clauses.


* Use LIMIT or TOP to retrieve only a specific number of rows.


* Use aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT to perform calculations on large amounts of data.
* Use GROUP BY to group data and improve query performance.


* Use EXISTS instead of IN or NOT IN clauses, as EXISTS is typically faster.


* Use a WHERE clause to filter data before retrieving it.


* Use CASE statements to perform conditional logic.


* Avoid using SELECT * to retrieve all columns when you only need a few columns.
* Use stored procedures to reduce network traffic and improve performance.


* Use views to simplify complex queries and reduce the amount of code needed.


* Use subqueries in the FROM clause instead of in the WHERE clause.


* Use table aliases to simplify query code and improve readability.


* Use UNION instead of UNION ALL if you need to remove duplicates.


* Avoid using functions in WHERE clauses, as they can slow down performance.


* Use EXPLAIN to analyze query performance and identify bottlenecks.


* Avoid using correlated subqueries if possible, as they can be slow.


* Use proper data types to optimize query performance.
* * Use stored procedures to reduce the number of round trips to the database.
* * Use temp tables to reduce query complexity and improve performance.
